![Vedant Jain Profile](https://ik.imagekit.io/zmc91qb0y1t/tr:w-150/portfolio/profile_OujidRzocJ.jpg "Vedant Jain Profile")

Hi, I’m Vedant.

I’m a Software Engineer passionate about building impactful solutions and learning through the process.

I discovered my love for programing during my undergraduate years and developed a passion for startups and building products during my first internship. I began with frontend development, transitioned to fullstack, and now focus primarily on backend development. Currently, I’m a Sr. Senior Engineer at Railofy, India’s largest food delivery-in-train startup.

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working with early-stage startups and collaborating closely with founders. This experience has shaped my product-focused approach to development, enabling me to:

- Consider the broader product-wide impacts of features.
- Design solutions that create net-positive outcomes for all stakeholders.
- Anticipate and plan for feature scalability and extensibility.
- Keep my fellow developers and mentees excited about the work we’re doing.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually learning about the philosophies of the greatest minds and practicing self-control. I’m also deeply interested in personal finance, health, and music. On the side, I’m a noob barista, experimenting with brewing the perfect cup of coffee. You can often find me obsessing over something new and fascinating.
