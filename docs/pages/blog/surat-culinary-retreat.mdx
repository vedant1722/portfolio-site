# Surat Trip: A Wedding, Friends, and Amazing Food

I recently visited Surat, to attend Jay's wedding. Jay is an integral part of the close group of friends,  i.e. the Railofy Tech Team. Needless to mention that every one from the group was present at Surat for the occasion. Over the years, we've shared work, laughs, and quite a few trips together.  This trip was especially bittersweet for me as it’s my last month at Railofy. It may be a long time until we all come together like this again.

Along with the tech group was my old college time friend (and also an ex-Railofy employee) - Mudit. Mudit runs *Kulche Shulche*, a popular restaurant in Surat, which is soon opening its second outlet.

With friends, celebrations, and fantastic food, this trip was a culinary retreat. Specially if you are a vegetarian. Here's a little taste of Surat's food scene, highlighting three must-visit places I explored.

## 1. Kulche Shulche

Mudit's restaurant, _Kulche Shulche_, brings the authenticity of Amritsari Kulchas to Surat. I haven’t had such amazing kulchas anywhere else! Served straight from the tandoor, the kulchas are wafer-crisp on the outside, thick, and fluffy on the inside. Pair them with your choice of gravy, accompanied by chutney, and pickled salad. Round off your meal with their Lassi.

The **Cheese Garlic Kulcha with Dal Makhni** is my favorite. _Kulche Shulche_ is perfect for a lazy Sunday lunch. If you're in Surat, this is a must-visit. Bonus: the warm hospitality from the owner himself makes the experience even better.

## 2. Shreeji Locho

Plan your breakfast at Shreeji Locho. You may often find a 10-15 queue to place your order here, but it's worth the wait. They have one of the best Locho in Surat - served with onion and chutney. You can top up the experience by having Piyush - A yogurt based drink they offer, after you have had Locho.

Start your day with breakfast at *Shreeji Locho*. Be prepared for a 10–15 minute queue to place your order, but it’s worth the wait. They serve one of the best *Lochos* in Surat —  served with onion and chutney.

**Pro tip**: Pair your Locho with *Piyush*, a delicious yogurt-based drink they offer.

## 3. P.  Bhagat Tarachand
We tried their **Parathas**, **Thali**, and **Paneer Gravy**—rich, flavorful, and loaded with butter! For dessert, the **Rabri with Gulab Jamun** and **Moong Dal Halwa** were pure comfort food. _P. Bhagat Tarachand_ is a must-visit for a hearty, traditional meal in Surat.

Everytime I visit Surat, I make sure to visit these three food spots.
