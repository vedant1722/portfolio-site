# Breaking Free from Confirmation Bias

**Confirmation Bias** is the tendency of our brain to recall incidents, memories, quotes, or values to strengthen our existing beliefs.
### But why do we feel the need to strengthen our beliefs?
Because the belief is falling apart without reinforcement. It needs re-affirmations from the past because it cannot be realised in the present. The belief lacks grounding in reality.

Repeated, unaware affirmations become habit and strengthen the belief further. The belief, which had no grounding, becomes our identity. It adds no value other than inducing a fear of losing your identity. The more you try to hold on to such beliefs, turning away from the truth, the more frightened you become over time. Soon you will find yourself resorting to violence to defend your beliefs.
### The Truth

If someone asks you to prove that you are breathing, you won't feel the need to get defensive. Nor do you get anxious or violent. That is because the truth of breathing can be realised at all times, in all moods and conditions. Such is the Truth.

Truth is unconditional. Its realisation is beyond constraints and contexts. It unfolds before you at all times. You may fail to see it in an effort to defend illusions, but it remains unshaken.

> Realisation is the instrument of Truth.
> Pain is a projection of Truth shattering your illusions

Truth is like a tree with roots, branches, leaves, and flowers - alive and complex, yet compelling. A belief you are trying to protect is like an illusion of a tree in the sky made up of clouds. You believed the clouds to be a tree, and it's okay if you did. But when you see a real tree, don't deny its existence. Don't carry the burden of your illusions. Pause for a while, and take a moment to see that the clouds have moved on.
### Tools:
- Lower your identity.
- Practise awareness of how you utilize past memories.
- Try not to judge or overlook the facts that may contradict your views.

*Letting go of false beliefs isn't a loss. It's the freedom to see the truth as it is. In that freedom lies clarity, peace, and growth.*
