# Breaking Free from Confirmation Bias

**Confirmation Bias** is the tendency of our brain to deliberately recall events, memories, quotes and values to strengthen our existing beliefs.
### But why would you do that?
Because your belief is falling apart without additional efforts. Your belief is not true. The Truth is shattering it. Reliance on past to re-affirm is a proof that your belief is weak. A belief that is borrowed and not self realised. A belief that lacks grounding.
### Pain is just a projection of Truth shattering your illusions.
A repetition of these beliefs becomes identity. There is no point in carrying the burden of such beliefs. It adds no value other than inducing a fear of losing your identity. The more you try to bind your believes together turning away from the truth, the more frightened you would get over time. Soon you would find yourself choosing violence to protect it. You don't need violence to prove that you are breathing. That is because the truth of breathing can be realized at all times, in all moods and conditions. Such is the Truth.
### The Truth
Truth is unconditional. Its realisation is beyond constraints and contexts. It unfolds before you at all times. You may fail to see it in efforts to protect your believe. But it would be a waste as Truth needs no protection. It will keep on glowing.

Truth is like a tree with roots, branches, leaves and flowers. A belief you are trying to protect against the truth is just an illusion of a tree - a tree made up of clouds that you "believed" to be true. There is no wrong if you believed so. But when you see a real tree, don't deny its existence. Don't carry the burden of your illusions. Take a moment to see for yourself that the clouds have moved on. It was a creative projection but it's time to move on.
### Tools:
- Lower your identity. Do not pollute the Truth. Truth is an instrument of realisation and not identification.

*Letting go of false beliefs isn't a loss. It's the freedom to see the truth as it is. In that freedom lies clarity, peace, and growth.*
